# Cassandra + Node

I am just playing around with Cassandra and Node. No mind blowing code or examples yet.

Mostly a Hello, World exercise.

## Register a user

```
POST /users
pass in username and email
```

## Chirps

```
POST /chirps
pass in username and message
```

```
GET /chirps
returns all chirps
```

```
GET /:user/chirps
return alls chirps for given user
```
